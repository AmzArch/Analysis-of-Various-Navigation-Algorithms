# Analysis-of-Various-Navigation-Algorithms

I completed the "Robotics, Autonomous Vehicles, Drones, and Artificial Intelligence" course at Harvard DCE, where the final project was a group project requiring a deep investigation into a related subject not covered in the curriculum. My group chose to study pathfinding algorithms, implementing A*, Weighted A*, Best First Search, A* with Beam Search, and the Rapidly Expanding Random Tree algorithms, and analyzed their relative performance. Check out our findings in our slide deck https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BlVRE6h7A6iw-55NXWSJVUY0FS-b3pqwuzmfVl1096g/edit?usp=sharing.
